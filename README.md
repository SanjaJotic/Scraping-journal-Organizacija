# Scraping journal Organizacija

I'm downloading pdfs from archive of all papers published in journal [Organizacija](http://organizacija.fov.uni-mb.si/index.php/organizacija/index). Then extracting name of all authors and keywords in individual paper to make an .edge file containing name of authors and number of keywords that are the same for the authors (.edge file is in form *Author1;Author2;Number of keywords that are the same for authors*).
